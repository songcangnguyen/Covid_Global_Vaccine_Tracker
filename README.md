# Covid_Global_Vaccine_Tracker

I build a Covid Vaccine Tracker dashboard to track how the vaccination program is performing worldwide using **Excel** and [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/song.cang.nguyen/viz/Covid-19GlobalVaccineTracker_16878151597950/Dashboard1?publish=yes). In this project, I took raw data and turned it into valuable insights to answers: 
* Number of people fully and partially vaccinated per Country and region.
* Percentage of people who are not vaccinated.
* Trending line for Vaccinated people over GDP in each country.
Click on Tableau for the Interactive dashboard.
