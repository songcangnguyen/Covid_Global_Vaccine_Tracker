# Covid Global Vaccine Tracker

I build a Covid Vaccine Tracker dashboard to track how the vaccination program is performing worldwide using **Excel** and [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/song.cang.nguyen/viz/Covid-19GlobalVaccineTracker_16878151597950/Dashboard1?publish=yes). 



## Questions
* What is the number of people fully and partially vaccinated per country and region?
* What is the percentage of people who are not vaccinated in each country and region?
* Provide the trending line for vaccinated people over GDP in each country.
